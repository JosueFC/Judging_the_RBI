This line chart displays Aaron Judge’s annual Runs Batted In (RBI) totals compared to the league average for all MLB players from 2017 to 2024. The orange solid line represents Judge, while the blue dashed line represents the league average.

Interpretation:
Judge consistently exceeds the MLB average in run production.
2020 shows a sharp dip due to the shortened pandemic season.
2022 and 2024 mark peak seasons, with RBI totals far surpassing league norms.
The steep climbs following down years (e.g., from 2020 → 2021, and 2023 → 2024) highlight Judge’s bounce-back power and elite offensive impact.

Takeaway:
Aaron Judge is not just a slugger but a top-tier run producer, reliably driving in runs at a rate unmatched by the average MLB player.
